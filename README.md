# QuaternionIntegrator.jl

Simple integrator for orientation quaternions. Given an orientation quaternion, an inertial
tensor and a function that gives torque as a function of orientation, this package allows
you to compute the time evolution of the orientation.

Currently untested and I have no idea of the accuracy.
